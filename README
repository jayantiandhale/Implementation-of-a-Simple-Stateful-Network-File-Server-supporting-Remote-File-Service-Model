SUMMARY:

Implemented a Simple Stateful Network File Server (SSNFS) that supports remote file service model.
The client accepts the following commands: open, list, delete, write, read, close.
1. open:  Requires a filename.  Opens a file with given name if present or Create a file with given name. Returns the file descriptor for a file.
2. list:  Lists all files owned by user.
3. delete: Requires a file descriptor.  Deletes file with given descriptor.
4. write: Requires a file descriptor, write length, and data.  Writes write length bytes of data to the file with given descriptor.
5. read: Requires a file descriptor, and read length.  Reads read length bytes from file with given descriptor. Returns the content read.
6. close: Removes file table entry for given file descriptor. Closes a file with given file descriptor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------==================
Build Instructions:

1. To build the programs, simply run "make".  Running rpcgen is not necessary, as it is run by the Makefile.
2. To delete all programs, build files, and virtual disk files, simply run "make clean".

3. To run the server program, simply run "./server".
4. To run the client program, simply run "./client hostname", where hostname is the name of the host running the server, e.g., "./client localhost" if the server is running on the same host.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------==================
NOTES:

1. File server uses a UNIX file as a virtual disk to store the files created by the clients. Server and client are implemented as Sun
2. RPC server and client. A virtual disk is a sequence of 512 bytes blocks. 
3. The virtual disk capacity is 10MB.
4. Maximum file table entries are assumed to be 100; considering maximum expected users and maximum files per user.

CONTENTS:
1. ssnfs.x
2. client.c
3. server.c
4. makefile
5. README

the make command will generate ssnfs.h, ssnfs_clnt.c, ssnfs_svc.c, ssnfs_xdr.c files and other required files.
